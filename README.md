## Python Script for Processing Inspector Traces

Inconveniences occur when we want to manipulate inspector traces such as merging, data trasferring etc.

This script intends to ease the following procedures:
- Transfer and merge raw data (trace) file(s) to a single Inpsector Tracefile
- Merge tracefiles (with or without header) to a single Tracefile with header
- Embed crypto data into tracefiles
- Convert tracefiles to numpy arrays

This Repo is under development and not completely usable at this time
